# Twist
Write with (a) Twist - An assistive writing application.

Twist is a writing app for people with busy lives. It helps you write every day by breaking down your project and giving you smaller tasks to work on one at a time. Just do "the next thing" every day, and the story you've been wanting to write all these years will be done in no time.

## Tenets & Philosophies
1) **Open Source** - The entire application should be open source to allow people the freedom to control their experience and avoid lock-in.
1) **Offline First** - All data and basic functionality should be available offline to give people control over their data.
